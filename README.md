#Serendipity Pinit Plugin

This is a plugin allow users to "pin" images on your [*serendipity blog platform*](http://www.s9y.org/) to [*Pinterest*](http://www.pinterest.com//).

The plugin munges your post on load, so it has been setup to work with the serendipity_event_entryproperties plugin 
(which adds entry caching).  Please ensure that plugin is installed and active to avoid performance issues.
